# hacktoberfest_vn
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.It doesn’t need to be code. It can be even documentation. Or spelling fix.
Before you begin :

1. Do not worry if you haven’t contributed to open-source before. This is your chance - this October and try making it count. If you have no idea on what opensource is, read this first.

2. You need to sign up on Digital Ocean before making any commit or pull request to get those count. You can use this referral link to sign up - and you’ll get free $10 - which you can use in hosting later on. You can use your Github Student Pack to earn more $25 dollars for Digital Ocean, after you sign up with this link.

3. Filter projects according to your interests and talk to the repository maintainers and or see if they have any open “issues” on their repository. If they have, comment there asking help on how to solve it and proceed as they guide you on comments.

You can also see what all projects got selected in Google Summer of Code for the last year, and make contributions to them. So, in case, you’re willing to apply for GSoC next year, these contributions will surely help.

4. After making 4 contributions (it can be to different repositories), just get back to your hackoctoberfest account and claim your free tshirt and stickers.


Rules
1) Do contributions made outside of GitHub count?
   No, PRs must be made on the GitHub platform.

2) Do issues/commits count?
   No, only PRs count.

3) I signed up for Hacktoberfest mid-October. Will PRs that I created earlier in October count?
   Yes, all pull requests created between Oct. 1 and Oct. 31 will count, regardless of when you register for Hacktoberfest.      Pull requests created before Oct. 1 but merged after do not count.

4) Do issues have to be labeled Hacktoberfest to count?
   No, any pull request made on a public repository counts, whether it’s attached to a Hacktoberfest issue or not.

5) Do PRs made on my own repos count?
   Yes, but we strongly encourage you to make quality contributions to other repositories.
